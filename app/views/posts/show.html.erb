    Regular HTML links can only make GET requests. "link_to"
    allows us to use other verbs such as DELETE. We pass a named
    argument called "method" with the symbol of the HTTP verb as
    an argument. If you confirm with the dialog then it will 
    make the request.

      data: { confirm: "Are you sure you want to delete this post?"}
